#### Better Discord

### Customization

In the main css file you will find some variables that you can change to match your desired color theme perfectly

* `--myc-background-hue`: specify which color will be used for the background. It is set to 0 by default which is Red. You can find the Hue of your favourite color by going to [htmlcolorcodes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/), selecting your color and copying the value next to "H".
* `--myc-background-saturation`: change how saturated the background color will be. A lower value will result in a more gray-ish image. If you are using light mode, you probably need to increase this value by a lot.
* `--myc-background-lightness`: change how bright the background color will be.
* `--myc-link-lightness: 1.5`: change how brightly links are displayed. You probably need to lower this value a bit if you are using light mode.
* `--myc-ui-lightness`: change how bright the Discord logo and some buttons are. With bright colors like yellow reducing this value improves readability in the settings page.
